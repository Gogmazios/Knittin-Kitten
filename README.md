# Knittin-Kitten
C# project from Spring 2016 semester.
A variation on Pacman. The player moves a kitten via WASD to collect colored yarn balls. A random color is specified as the target color, awarding one point each. A goldfish bowl speeds up the kitten, a sprig of catnip alters the colors of the yarn balls at random, and a pair of knitting-needles awards bonus points and instantly ends the game. Developed entirely in Visual Studio.
